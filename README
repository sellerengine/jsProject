jsProject
=========
A flexible base for developing and deploying javascript projects based around RequireJS.

Includes jQuery and coffeescript support by default, as well as an added module for css support.

Usage
=====
Run ./forkJsProject.py {project name} to fork a new jsProject in a sibling folder.  The new project will refer to jsProject itself through relative paths, and is a skeleton demonstration of what a compiling project looks like.  

The base of your new project's javascript (or coffeescript) code will be in webapp/src.  There is also a demonstration web server in server/, which of course may be replaced if desired (or if you don't use cherrypy).
